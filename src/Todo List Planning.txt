Todo List Planning


                    What it needs

Todos - title, description, dueDate, priority, completed(y/n)

Projects - can store multiple todos if needed
    - todos outside of projects get stored in a 'default' project
    - should be able to create new projects and add todos to existing projects


Way to view all projects
View all todos in each project (probably just title and duedate, changing color for different properties?)
expand a single todo to see/edit details
delete a todo/project

use localStorage





function App (

    return (
        <div>


        </div>
    )
)

const DisplayProjects = () => {
    maps and displays the Projects
    if a project is clicked, pass the project name to <DisplayTodos />
    if a project is deleted, pass that down to <DisplayTodos /> so that the relevant Todos can also be removed
}

const DisplayTodos = (props) => {
    holds the Todos, maps, and displays the correct ones based off of the project clicked in <DisplayProjects />
    handles the toggling of Todo completion 
    manages the deletion of Todos
    deletes the relevant todos if a project they are assigned to is deleted
}
